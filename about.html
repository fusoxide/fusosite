<h1>Who am I?</h1><br>
I am fusoxide, a 20 year old person from Scotland. I am interested in many topics, such as retro computing, aesthetics, video games and music. My main hobbies are creating music, documenting obscure finds, and procrastinating.<br><br>
My interests in more detail:<br><br>
<ul class="list">
<li>Gaming: Although I don't play games regularly nowadays, I have loved them since I was a kid. The ones I’m most into are probably by Nintendo, Sega, Namco and Valve. In particular, I enjoy video game music, especially obscure stuff.</li>
<li>90s/2000s aesthetics: I love various different (tech-related) aesthetics, such as Y2K and old web aesthetics</li>
<li>Technology: I've always been into technology, especially the audio-visual aspects such as sounds, wallpapers and themes. I am also interested in the history of products like Windows and phones.</li>
<li>Anime: I only watch anime from time to time (and honestly mostly slice-of-life stuff), but I do love anime girls.</li><br>
</ul>
My hobbies in more detail: <br><br>
<ul class="list">
<li>Music composition/arrangement: Not an expert on music theory, but I love creating music, especially VGM-inspired stuff. You should <a href="music.html">check it out!</a></li>
<li>Design: I don’t really do graphic design as much as I used to anymore, but I still do this from time-to-time and would like to get better.</li>
<li>Research/archival: I like to research and archive stuff related to my niche interests. Efforts I make include writing wiki pages, creating spreadsheets, contacting original authors, and dumping CDs.</li>
</ul>
<br>
I would like to talk to more people with common interests. I also want to get into other media, so feel free to chat to me about basically anything!<br><br>
I spend a lot of my time on Twitter, in fact that's probably where you found this website. Before you follow, please consider the following:<br><br>
<ul class="list">
<li>I usually do not follow back, and don't take it too personally if I don't. I do often follow back people with many shared mutuals, or generally people who interest me right away. Don't follow just in the hopes I follow back; at least make an effort to engage with me first.</li>
<li>If we are mutuals and I do unfollow, it's probably because we rarely interact. Up to you if you want to unfollow me back or not. I may also softblock too.</li>
<li>As for my "do not interact" criteria, that pretty much just consists of anyone who is bigoted (homophobic, racist, etc), problematic, or actively part of communities I have cut ties with. I'll possibly soft/hardblock you if you fall under said criteria.</li>
<li>I am not always actively tweeting here. This is because I rarely produce content worth showing to the public, while I prefer casually tweeting on other private accounts.</li>
</ul>
