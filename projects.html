<h1>My projects</h1><br>
Other than my music, I have created several projects over the years, so here's the ones I am most proud of. Many of these focus on researching and documenting rather niche, nerdy topics, but ultimately I feel I have done a lot of good things for them. Another reason I tend to work on more niche projects is because I like to "fill in the gaps"; documenting stuff that people take for granted and thus no one else has bothered to do so before. I hope you're interested in these!<br><br>
<h2>Ringtone Bangers + More</h2><br>
I run a Twitter account called Ringtone Bangers, which posts two great tracks a day related to technology, particularly ringtones. I created this as I feel many ringtones are underappreciated and are legitimately good pieces of music, but are often ignored and not taken seriously. Amazingly, the account has managed to gain a large cult following of over 50K+ followers, with several ringtones gaining thousands of likes. If this account sounds like your cup of tea, go follow it!<br><br>
<a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="300" data-height="400" data-theme="dark" href="https://twitter.com/ringtonebangers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Tweets by ringtonebangers</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><br> 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ringtonebangers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @ringtonebangers</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><br>
Asides from running that account, I am legitimately interested in ringtones and who made them/how they were made. I have done a lot of research on them through my Google-fu and contacting the original composers; my finds are documented on spreadsheets and other forms.<br><br>
<h2>Wallpaper projects</h2><br>
I have also created many projects related to Windows wallpapers, something that I'm oddly interested in. These include: packs featuring higher resolution versions of wallpapers, a wiki dedicated to this subject, and a spreadsheet where I document my finds. Although I am more focused on other work nowadays, I feel I have excelled with my work as I have been able to spread high resolution wallpapers and previously undiscovered information.<br><br>

I am currently also working on a large pack of every last official Windows wallpaper I can find. I am taking my time with this pack, so that I can get it as complete as possible. Stay tuned!
